- Added shadcn/ui components: card, button, tabs, progress
- Created full project directory structure per PRD
- Created TypeScript type definitions (health-data.ts, analytics.ts)
- Created Apple Health metric type mappings config (config/metrics.ts)
- Set up SQLite database schema with 3 tables: records, workouts, fitness_scores
- Created database client with auto-initialization and WAL mode
- Created reusable database query functions (batch insert, aggregations, daily averages/sums)
- Created utility functions for date handling and metric formatting
- Built empty dashboard page with layout (fitness score, 4 metric cards, trends placeholder)
- Built import page placeholder with Apple Health export instructions
- Created database initialization script (scripts/init-db.ts)
- Verified project builds successfully and database initializes correctly
- Committed as initial commit

## Phase 2: Data Import - COMPLETED

### What was done:
- Created XML parser (src/lib/parsers/xml-parser.ts):
  - Parses Apple Health export.xml files efficiently using fast-xml-parser
  - Handles large files (100MB+) with batch processing
  - Extracts health records and workouts with metadata
  - Supports both ZIP and raw XML file extraction
  - Includes validation and progress tracking
- Created data mapper (src/lib/parsers/data-mapper.ts):
  - Maps parsed XML data to database schema
  - Converts Apple Health type identifiers to readable names
  - Deduplicates records and workouts before insertion
  - Filters records by category (cardio, activity, body, recovery)
- Created import API route (src/app/api/import/route.ts):
  - POST endpoint for file upload (supports .zip and .xml)
  - Batch insert with deduplication handling
  - Progress tracking and error handling
  - GET endpoint for import statistics
  - Processes and imports data in batches of 1000 for performance

  - Error handling and validation
  - Auto-redirect to dashboard after successful upload
- Updated import page to use FileUpload component
- Installed adm-zip package for ZIP file extraction
- All type checks pass and project builds successfully

### Next up: Phase 3 - Analytics Engine
- Implement fitness scoring algorithm
- Build trend analysis and statistical calculations
- Create analytics API route
- Compute daily fitness scores for historical data
